							<h3 class="title">Studio Art Major</h3>
							<p class="body">Promotes the distinct benefits of studying art in an environment that reflects the values and goals of a liberal arts education. It is a rigorous program of study designed to provide students with the technical, visual, and conceptual foundations that will allow them to thrive in the most competitive arenas of contemporary art.</p>

							<p class="body">Knox offers concentrations in ceramics, painting, printmaking, sculpture, and photography, as well as courses in drawing, design, and alternative media. The six members of the faculty are a diverse group of practicing artists and intellectuals who share a commitment to providing our students with a richly challenging education to prepare them for fulfilling lives in the visual arts. The department maintains a regular exhibit schedule, bringing noted artists to campus to exhibit and lecture about their work.</p>

							<p class="body">Knox’s studio art majors are regularly accepted to the most competitive of MFA programs, including: Alfred University, American University, Boston University, Cranbrook Academy of Art, Maryland Institute College of Art, Mills College, New York Studio School, Otis College of Art and Design, Parson the New School of Design, Rhode Island School of Design, The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Tyler School of Art, University of Illinois at Chicago, University of Iowa, University of Pennsylvania, and Yale University School of Art</p>

							<h3 class="title">Curriculum</h3>
							<p class="body">The goal of our curriculum is to develop and creatively activate the material, visual, and intellectual skills that will allow students to flourish as artists and thoughtful participants in visual culture. Through courses in Art History and theory, and an emphasis on critical discourse, students learn to think and communicate about art with clarity. The Knox Art faculty are committed to representing the complex relationships which link the material and visual aspects of art-making to the full spectrum of experiences and ideas which make us human. Art students are encouraged to inform their work by drawing broadly on their studies in other disciplines.</p>

							<p class="body">The Studio Art Major consists of 12 credits, or one-third of the 36 total credits required for Graduation from Knox College. Students are required to take seven studio-art courses in addition to 3 courses in Art History. Among these courses are drawing, beginning and intermediate courses in either painting, sculpture, ceramics, photography or printmaking, and advanced courses where students gradually assume independence in guiding their artistic development.</p>
